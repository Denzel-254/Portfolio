            <h2>Welcome to <span>my digital space.</span> </h2>

            <p>Am a Data Analyst and Web Developer with a passion for solving problems
                through technology.
                My journey started with a curiosity for how data can shape decisions and how websites can connect
                people.
                I enjoy working with data visualization, building dashboards, and creating clean, responsive websites
                that provide value to users.
                Am currently expanding my skills in Excel, SQL, Python, and web development, while building real-world
                projects to showcase my growth.

                    <h2>My Skills and Expertise</h2>

                    <p>My journey started with a curiosity for how data can shape decisions and how websites can connect
                        people.
                        I enjoy working with data visualization, building dashboards, and creating clean, responsive
                        websites that provide value to users.
                        I’m currently expanding my skills in Excel, SQL, Python, and web development, while building
                        real-world projects to showcase my growth.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I love working at the intersection of data and design.
                        When I’m not coding websites , I’m analyzing datasets to uncover patterns and insights.
                        I believe that data tells powerful stories, and my goal is to translate those stories into
                        meaningful solutions.
                        This portfolio is a reflection of my learning journey, where I share projects, experiments, and
                        skills I’m proud of.</p>

                    <br><br>

                    <p class="pp">For me, data is more than numbers — it’s knowledge waiting to be uncovered.
                        And websites are more than code — they’re experiences waiting to be shared.
                        Through my projects, I aim to combine creativity and logic to build solutions that make an
                        impact.
